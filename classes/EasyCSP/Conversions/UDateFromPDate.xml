<p>
Return the unix epoch equivalent of a pick date and time.  If the time isn't
supplied, midnight (the start of the day) is assumed. (This mode will work
for Cache.) Note: Pick dates and Cache dates are reckoned similarly but from
a different "zero" day. Pick (hence MV) considers December 31, 1969 as the
"zero" day. Cache usually uses December 31, 1840. The date integer reflects
the number of days since the zero day. The difference between the two is 46,385.
</p>
<p>
Unix (and all web-based) processing uses yet another zero day: December 31, 1967.
