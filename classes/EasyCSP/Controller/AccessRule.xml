<Description><![CDATA[

Rules are divided into chains. At this writing, only two chains are defined: "allow" and "deny".
Thus, if a rule exactly fits the conditions presented, an action will be explicitly either allowed
or denied. TODO: allow rule-entrainment (JUMP-TO).
Give each rule a unique id so it can occupy a unique spot in a collection of rules]]></Description>
